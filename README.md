## About The Project

In today's fast-paced digital world, businesses often struggle with the sheer volume of customer inquiries. Manually responding to each query is time-consuming, costly, and prone to inconsistency.

**Responder AI** tackles this challenge head-on. It's a web application where a business can see incoming customer queries and, with a single click, generate a well-crafted, context-aware draft response. The AI uses a knowledge base to find the most relevant information, which a support agent can then review, edit, and send in a fraction of the time.

This project is a demonstration of building a modern, full-stack application that solves a tangible business problem, showcasing skills in both frontend and backend development, as well as deployment and product thinking.

### Key Features:

* **Interactive Dashboard:** A clean, modern, and fully responsive UI for managing customer queries.
* **AI-Powered Drafts:** Generates context-aware responses by searching a knowledge base for keywords.
* **Confidence Score:** Each AI draft comes with a confidence score, helping agents gauge the relevance of the suggestion.
* **Light & Dark Mode:** A professional, polished UI with theme toggling.
* **Full-Stack Architecture:** Decoupled frontend and backend for scalability and maintainability.
